Applications of DFS:
 1. For weighted graph, minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree
 2. detecting cycle in graph
 3. path finding from source to destination - use a stack, add the source and keep traversing the graph, 
 if the destination is encountered return the path
 4. topological sorting
 5. check if the graph is bipartite
 6. finding strongly connected graphs
 7. solving puzzles with 1 solution
