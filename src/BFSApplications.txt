Applications of BFS:
1. Shortest path and minimum spanning tree - in an unweighted tree the shortest path is 
with the least number of vertices
2. Peer to Peer network identification - like in bittorrent
3. Crawlers in search engine
4. Social networking websites - finding all people  within a given distance k
5. gps navigation
6. broadcasting network
7. garbage collection
8. cycle detection in undirected graph
9. path finding - although, DFS can also be used for this.
10. finding all nodes within 1 connected component - DFS or BFS can be used to find all nodes that are reachable
from the given node.
